Write down ideas, no matter how small. they connect to create the story.
a book is not 1 idea! can fit a small story though.

# Promise
stories make a promise to the reader, how do I deliberately make promises that fit my story and deliver on them.
types of promises: 
* tone - indicate the tone and style of the story in the opening chapters.
* character arc - what are the characters desires, what's preventing them (or what the character SHOULD want, but doesn't). What is the character missing, how will the character change? 
* plot - what type of story is this


Prologues let the writer promise the tone of action and adventure before starting with "a kid on a farm...".
